## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties for a consistent theme
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design techniques

### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce the importance of:

- Using CSS variables allowed me to keep the design consistent and easily adjustable:

```
:root {
  --Dark-Ash-Gray: hsl(97, 18%, 68%);
  --Melon: hsl(12, 52%, 72%);
}
```

### Continued Development

While this project improved my understanding of HTML and CSS, I plan to concentrate on the following areas in future projects:

- Enhancing responsive design.
- Deepening my understanding of CSS for complex designs.
